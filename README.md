# ESP8266-bubbles
This sketch sends number of bubbles and current temperature to ThingSpeak for beer fermentation monitoring. Use optocoupler module (pin5 = D1) for counting bubbles on the top of the fermentation tank and DS18B20 OneWire temperature sensor (pin4 = D2). Set your wifi credentials, thingspeak API key, update period, temperature sensor calibration offset and hostname.
